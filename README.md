Using python to create a database of anime and manga

Files containing a list of manga and manga were created using the following prompts in Claude 3.5 in July 2024:
1) Write a CSV file-style text containing the 50 most popular manga where the columns are a unique identifier number (beginning at 1), a 3-letter shortening of the title, the title, the author, it's status (ongoing, completed, hiatus), the number of chapters, and the number of volumes
2) Write a CSV file-style text containing the 50 most popular anime where the columns are a unique identifier number (beginning at 1), a 3-letter shortening of the title, the title, the studio that produces the anime, and how many seasons that anime has
