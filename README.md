# AniManga_Database
Using python to create a database of anime and manga

Files containing a list of anime and manga were created using the following prompts in Claude 3.5 in July 2024:
1) Write a CSV file-style text containing the title of the 50 most popular anime, the studio that produces the anime, and how many seasons that anime has
2) Write a CSV file-style text containing the title of the 50 most popular manga, the author, it's status (ongoing, completed, hiatus), the number of chapters, and the number of volumes
