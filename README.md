# AniManga Database
An in-progress project that aims to track user's consumption of manga and anime using a database. I started this project because I thought it would be a fun way to learn more about databases. All current work has been done in about 2 hours & while I plan on making this usable one day, it will only be worked on intermitently. 

Files containing a list of manga and anime were created using the following prompts in Claude 3.5 in July 2024:
1) Write a CSV file-style text containing the 50 most popular manga where the columns are a unique identifier number (beginning at 1), a 3-letter shortening of the title, the title, the author, it's status (ongoing, completed, hiatus), the number of chapters, and the number of volumes
2) Write a CSV file-style text containing the 50 most popular anime where the columns are a unique identifier number (beginning at 1), a 3-letter shortening of the title, the title, the studio that produces the anime, and how many seasons that anime has
